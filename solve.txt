**Step 1 - Problem Statement and Requirements:**
1. Develop a FriendsBook application (a simple social network).
2. Create a Profile class with attributes: username, first name, last name, email address, and birthday.
3. Implement the following functionalities for the FriendsBook application:
   a. Allow users to join the social network by creating a profile.
   b. Enable users to search for profiles by username.
   c. Allow users to modify their profile (name, email address, birthday).
   d. Implement a way for users to leave the social network.
   e. Implement a function to print all current users in ascending order of username.

**Step 2 - Design and Step 3 - Implementation:**
4. Design the MyADT class to manage Profile objects.
5. The MyADT class should have methods with specific time efficiencies:
   a. The insert method must have a time efficiency of O(m).
   b. The search method must have a time efficiency of O(m) or O(log m).
   c. The remove method must have a time efficiency of O(m).
   d. Modify a Profile object efficiently.
   e. The print method must have a time efficiency of O(n).

**File Organization:**
6. Create the MyADT class implementation (MyADT.cpp) based on the provided header (MyADT.h).
7. Implement the FriendsBook application in the FriendsBook.cpp file.
8. Ensure that each file contains a comment header block with filename, class description, class invariant (if any), author, date of creation/last modification.
9. Document all class methods (public and private) with descriptions, preconditions (if any), and postconditions (if any).
10. Use only arrays for your solution; do not use linked lists.
11. Do not use the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ for this project.
12. Ensure your code follows the Good Programming Style guidelines mentioned in the course material.
