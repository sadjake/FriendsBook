notes

each person in social network must have
profile containing person's username,
name (first and last), email, and bday

join social network (create profile for user)

search for particular profile
(using username of profile)

allows user to modify name, email address,
birthday of user, but not username
- does this mean username is private and
everything else is public?

leave the social network (by removing the user's profile from the network)
